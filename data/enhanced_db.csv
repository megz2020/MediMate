If you have a baby and you were receiving infliximab during your pregnancy, it is important to tell your baby’s doctor and other health care professionals about your infliximab use so they can decide when your baby should receive any vaccine. Certain vaccinations can cause infections. If you received infliximab while you were pregnant, your baby may be at higher risk for getting an infection. If your baby receives a live vaccine within 6 months after birth, your baby may develop infections with serious complications that can lead to death. This includes live vaccines such as the BCG, rotavirus, or any other live vaccines. For other types of vaccines, talk with your doctor Storage Store unopened infliximab vials in a refrigerator at 2ºC to 8ºC (36ºF to 46ºF). If needed, unopened infliximab vials may be stored at room temperatures up to a maximum of 30ºC (86°F) for a single period of up to 6 months but not exceeding the original expiration date. The new expiration date must be written in the space provided on the carton. Once removed from the refrigerator, infliximab cannot be returned to the refrigerator.
