## MediMate For production

We plan to deploy the model on Google Cloud Platform and use it to serve the web app. We will use Google Cloud's Vertex AI to train our model and deploy it to the cloud. We will use ZILLIZ as vector database to store the vector of the image. We will use openAi embedding to get the vector of the image. We will use Langchin to designe and integrate LLM service. We will use Streamlit to build the web app. We will use trulens to evaluate the model result.

- For frontend, we will use vue.js to build the web app. 
- For backend, we will use fastapi to build the backend service.

### currentlly, we have finished frontend only and we are working on the backend service.
